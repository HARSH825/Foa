## The Market Gap

## **Find brief comparison between FOA and other platforms here** : [Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ey7EkErsjS4Pqr84OI52hVF7BYvLa1Og?usp=drive_link)

**All other platforms** focus on:
- Recruiters, not candidates
- Text-based Q&A or peer reviews
- One-size-fits-all questions
- No personalization, no context

> 🛑 None of them offer a **resume-aware,context aware , real-time voice interview simulation** with tailored feedback.
